Because I’m afraid.\n\nBecause this isn’t you vs me.\nThis should be all of us vs hate. All of us vs violence.\n\nWe deserve to live.\nWe deserve to feel safe.\nWe deserve to be human - without fear.\n\nKashmir is one of the most beautiful place - we call it the 'Heaven' and we all should be able to walk freely there!\n\nI had a conversation with my mother 1 month back to plan a solo trip there and she completely said NO, now I understand her pov.\n\nThis was planned because Kashmir was healing.\nHope was returning.\n\nThat’s all I wanted to say.\nThat’s all my heart could take today.",

  "text": "I was diagnosed with 'depression' a few months back and I am here to talk about it.\n\nI have been taking prescribed anti-depressants too.\n\nWriting this post is hard? \nYes.\n\nI know that some people aren't supportive and will say that I am doing this for attention - have been there already.\n\nOpenly discussing mental health is crucial because it promotes awareness and normalizes mental health as a part of overall well-being. \n\nWhenever I needed a day off, I used sick leave and I think it’s understandable to use mental health days under sick leave, especially if there’s a concern about societal shyness or stigma. \n\nNo one really talks about it. Right?\n\nHowever, fostering open conversations can gradually shift perceptions and create a more accepting environment.\n\nHere are some reasons why talking about mental health matters:\n\nReduces Stigma: \n\nOpen discussions can help dispel myths and reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues, making it easier for individuals to seek support without fear of judgment.\n\nEncourages Help-Seeking: \n\nWhen mental health is openly talked about, it can encourage others to seek help early, which can lead to better outcomes.\n\nImproves Support in Workplaces:\n\n If employers are aware of the importance of mental health, they may be more likely to implement supportive policies and resources.\n\n\nPromotes Empathy and Understanding: \n\nSharing experiences can foster empathy among peers, leading to stronger, more supportive relationships.\n\nRecognizes Mental Health as a Priority: \n\nMental health is just as important as physical health, and acknowledging this can ensure that individuals prioritize their mental well-being.\n\nTalking about our mental health is really important, just like talking about a cold or a headache. \n\nWhen we're open about needing a break because we're feeling stressed or down, it helps everyone understand that it's okay to have these feelings. \n\nIt's like saying, 'Hey, I'm not feeling great today, and I need some time to feel better.'\n\nWhen we hide our mental health days as just 'sick leave,' we miss the chance to show that our minds need care too. \n\nBut when we're honest about it, we help make it normal to talk about mental health. \n\nThis can make more people feel okay about taking a break when they need it, without feeling shy or worried about what others will think.\n\nSo, even if it feels a bit scary to talk about our mental health, it's a really brave thing to do. It helps us take better care of ourselves and each other. ",
